This option does not override the revalidate value set by individual fetch requests.\n\n- false: (default) The default heuristic to cache any fetch requests that set their cache option to 'force-cache' or are discovered before a dynamic function is used. Semantically equivalent to revalidate: Infinity which effectively means the resource should be cached indefinitely. It is still possible for individual fetch requests to use cache: 'no-store' or revalidate: 0 to avoid being cached and make the route dynamically rendered. Or set revalidate to a positive number lower than the route default to increase the revalidation frequency of a route.\n- 0: Ensure a layout or page is always dynamically rendered even if no dynamic functions or uncached data fetches are discovered. This option changes the default of fetch requests that do not set a cache option to 'no-store' but leaves fetch requests that opt into 'force-cache' or use a positive revalidate as is.\n- number: (in seconds) Set the default revalidation frequency of a layout or page to n seconds.\n    ",
